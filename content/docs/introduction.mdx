# Welcome to your docs

This is your documentation site, powered by **Metakit**. Everything you write here commits straight to your GitHub repo.

## Getting started

### What you can do

- **Toggle to code** — Switch to MDX view anytime for full control
- **Collaborate via Git** — Every edit is a commit. Branch, review, merge.
